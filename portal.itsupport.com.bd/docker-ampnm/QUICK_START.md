# Docker AMPNM - Quick Start Card

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Start Container
```bash
# Faster on slow links: pre-pull images first
docker compose pull

# Then build/run (shows full download progress)
docker compose up --build --progress=plain -d
```

> ⏳ First start can take several minutes while Docker downloads the MySQL base image and builds PHP packages. Keep the terminal open until you see the containers finish downloading/building.
> 🔁 If you hit `unexpected EOF` while pulling, rerun `docker compose pull db --progress=plain` (or `docker pull mysql:8`) to resume the largest layer, then rerun the start command.

### Step 2: Access Application
Open browser: `http://YOUR_IP:2266`

### Step 3: Complete Setup Wizard
The system will guide you through:

1. **Database Setup** - Click "Setup Database"
2. **Create Admin** - Enter username/password
3. **Enter License** - Paste your license key
4. **Login** - Use your admin credentials

**Done!** You're ready to add devices.
